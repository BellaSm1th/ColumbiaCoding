          Welcome to stacker! As you know, Team Navy has been developing a website/game to present. After a lot of creative ideas, they decided to recreate the infamous stacker arcade game. The goal of stacker is to align the rows of boxes on top of each other, winning a prize if the boxes reach the top. If you have played Tetris before, then you should know exactly how difficult this game can get. Team Navy knew they wanted to create a fun, unique, and challening game so they chose Stacker. As difficult as it was, Team Navy's hard work, dedication, and coding skills have helped them not only develope this game, but also expand their knowledge in html, css, and javascript. 
        </p>
